# Data formats

You can see what parameters each class has by looking at their respective class files ([`Magister`](/src/index.ts) [`MagisterClass`](/src/class.ts) [`MagisterClassRoom`](/src/classroom.ts) [`MagisterTeacher`](/src/teacher.ts) [`MagisterSubject`](/src/subject.ts) [`MagisterPerson`](/src/MagisterPerson.ts)). 

As to Magisters data format, I can not say. That really is just a case of trial and error on different endpoints and see what works.
